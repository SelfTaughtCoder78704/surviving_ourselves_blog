      subtitle: "Chapter 2: The Hunt for the Caddy",
      content: "<p>Alex and Jake were on a mission to find a 92 Fleetwood Caddy. Their half-brother, Q, had told them that the car was wanted because it had matching doors that he needed for his own car. Alex and Jake knew of a place where they could find the car, an apartment complex in Riverside, from past experiences.</p>As they arrived at the complex, they quickly scanned the parking lot for the Caddy. It was there, just as they had hoped. The car had already been stolen once before, and the steering column had been broken, but they knew they just needed to stick an item in the column to pull the teeth and start the car. They quickly found a wire hanger, bent and shaped it to fit the ignition, and the car roared to life.<p>With the car in their possession, they headed towards the East side of town, where Q was waiting for them in the SHACK. As they drove through the neighborhood, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The area was known for being dangerous and they knew that they were in the middle of a crack-dealing operation. But they were focused on their goal and were determined to deliver the car to Q, who they looked up to due to his success.</p><p>When they finally arrived at the designated spot, Q was waiting for them. He was pleased to see the car and gave them the ounce of crack as promised. However, the brothers now had no car and needed a ride from Q to get back to the southside. They knew that they had taken a risk, but they were also aware of the potential payoff. They were ready for whatever came next, whether it was success or failure.</p>",
